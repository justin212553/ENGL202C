# Assignment 5: Document Redesign
Design is an increasingly important facet of technical communication. With even basic computer programs like Microsoft Word, writers can adjust the visual aspects of their documents to enhance communication and clarity. Writers can also design text in sophisticated ways. This assignment will ask you to redesign a document for a specific rhetorical situation and to reflect on the decisions you made in the design process.

This assignment functions as something of a final project. Your redesign should demonstrate that you understand the principles and practices of technical communication discussed in this class. You can’t cover everything, of course, but you should work to convince me that you understand the key ideas we’ve been studying and talking about. The process you will follow is relatively straightforward. You will identify (with my approval) a document to be redesigned and a context for that redesign. You will then redesign the document based on a general rubric provided below. Finally, you will write a reflective commentary that discusses why you redesigned the document the way that you did.

Note that this redesign project is not simply an academic exercise meant to test what you have learned, although I certainly care about that. Technical communication documents are living documents; technical communicators constantly redesign their work in order to improve it. For example, visit the WayBack Machine Links to an external site.at archive.org. At this site you can enter a website address to see how the site has evolved over time. Try looking at the Penn State website. You will see how the site has developed over nearly two decades of both textual and visual revisions. With each version of the site, the technical communicators were working to improve its effectiveness for users.

# Document Redesign Planning worksheet
### Does the document you’ve selected necessitate substantial revision of the original document? Is it the appropriate length for this revision assignment (2 to 3 pages)? Provide a link or a copy of your original project.

### What are the most significant weaknesses of the original document? In what ways did the document fall short rhetorically, textually, visually, or otherwise?

Lack of consistency
-	These websites have inconsistent design. Although color choices are consistent, their layouts and design choices are different with each other, even though they are dealing with the same topic of the graduate school admission of UCLA.

Bad choices of styling headings
-	Admissions Requirements for the Graduate Major in Computer Science of UCLA page have awkward choices on the text size of headings. Its headings are often smaller than the contents, and have no colors that are inconsistent with other pages' stylings. 

Lack of emphasizing important contents
-	As a candidate of the UCLA graduate school, I had a hard time finding information about UCLA’s minimum requirements for the graduate school. I think adding some stylings inside the content would help candidates to easily spot important informations from long lines of texts.


### What strengths from the original document do you want to preserve or build upon?

Color consistency
-	These pages have consistent color choices. Light blue is the representative color of UCLA, and UCLA is using this color consistently for emphasizing headings and links to the other pages.

Rhetorical styles
-	Word choices and tones are professional and straight-forward. I think changing the contents of the pages do not have to be changed or need clarification.


### Would your redesigned document benefit from adopting a new medium or format? Why or why not? Is the content of the document appropriate to the specific medium? If you plan to redesign your project as a visual medium or genre, draft a quick, rough sketch of your design.

No. Admission pages are better to be left in web pages. Other mediums such as audio or video might misconvey information because of tones, pronunciation, etc. Also, admission pages should be able to help candidates to explore through majors and programs, which needs user-interaction features and easy access to data.


### Do you possess the technical skills necessary to complete an adequate redesign of the original document? For instance, if the original document can only be improved by using Photoshop, do you know how to use Photoshop effectively?

I can do coding for designing and deploying websites using React.js and Github deploy systems. Also, I can make user interfaces to make websites interact with users.
